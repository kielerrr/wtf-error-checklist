The checklist you need when your code doesn't love you.

- Mis-spellings
- All includes pointing correctly. Check every character in path
- SSL installed correctly? sslchecker.com
- File/folder permissions
- Dependencies versions and integrity
- Nord/vpn/networking interference
- Am I working in the right directory? am I working on an archived backup?
- Slow site? is xdebug etc still active
- Could the error be somewhere besides the place I've been looking for the last 6 hours? Shift focus
- Are you giving up to early? If program hangs, make sure the process is actually dead and not just slow.
- Are my indents correct? 
- Can't get wifi interisital to load. http://neverssl.com to force load
